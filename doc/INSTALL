Zotonic installation
======================

You will need to:

1. Install Erlang R12B (13B might also work). Build it from source, or
   use packages (see platform-specific notes below)
2. Install ImageMagick 'convert' and 'identify' tools (also install
   libjpeg, -tiff, -png and other required libraries).  Make sure that
   the convert and identify tools are in your path so that zotonic can
   find them.
3. Install PostgreSQL (preferably 8.3 or newer).
4. Obtain a copy of the Zotonic source code.


Steps:

0. Make sure you put the zotonic source in a directory named 'zotonic'
   (important for now; we're working on a solution for this).

1. Type "make" in the root of zotonic (there where the Makefile is located). (*1)

2. Create an user and database in PostgreSQL:

CREATE USER zotonic WITH PASSWORD 'yourdbpassword';
CREATE DATABASE zotonic WITH OWNER = zotonic ENCODING = 'UTF8';
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE zotonic TO zotonic;
\c zotonic
CREATE LANGUAGE "plpgsql";

4. Create the configuration for the default site by copying
   priv/sites/default/config.in to priv/sites/default/config

5. Edit this file; at least specify the credentials to the postgres database.

5. Make sure that the directory "priv/sites/default" and all its subdirectories are readable 
   and writeable for the current user. (Which is the user zotonic will run under.)

6. Start zotonic in debug mode:

  ./start.sh

7. You see zotonic starting up, lots of messages pass by, and zotonic will install the initial database.
   When something goes wrong here, then it is almost always a problem with the database connection. Check your 
   database configuration in the zotonic.sh file.

8. Point your browser to 
	
    http://localhost:8000/
	
   or logon as admin (the default password is 'admin') at: 

    http://localhost:8000/admin/

9. When all done, then you can stop the erlang shell with:

    q().
  



Operating system specific notes:
-------------------------------

FreeBSD:
-------
If you're running on FreeBSD, make sure you've got the 'GNU' 'make'
(check with 'make --version', which should give you GNU, and version
info) If you're not running GNU-make as a default, edit the Makefile
to run with 'gmake' (make sure gmake is available first))



Ubuntu 9.04 (jaunty)
--------------------

You'll need to build erlang from source. Before building, make sure
you install these packages:

sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev libncurses-dev libssl-dev



Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic)
--------------------
Instead of compiling erlang, you can install the following erlang packages:

sudo apt-get install erlang-base erlang-crypto erlang-dev erlang-docbuilder \
erlang-edoc erlang-et erlang-eunit erlang-gs erlang-inets \
erlang-mnesia erlang-observer erlang-odbc erlang-parsetools \
erlang-public-key erlang-runtime-tools erlang-ssl \
erlang-syntax-tools erlang-tools erlang-webtool erlang-xmerl
