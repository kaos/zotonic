Welcome to Zophrenic

Here we give you some starting points for your journey with Zophrenic.


INSTALLING

When you want to install Zophrenic, please read the file "doc/INSTALL".
When you want to proxy Zophrenic using nginx, then check also the file "doc/INSTALL.nginx" for an example site definition.


FOR ERLANG HACKERS

When you want to read the source, then start with "src/zophrenic_sup.erl" and work your way down using the servers defined in there.  After you have an idea what is what.  Then check the modules to see how they implement all the functionality, start with "mod_base".


FOR TEMPLATE WIZARDS

Start to scan the modules to see how templates, actions, resources and css/javascript are defined.  Especially the module "mod_base" is of interest as it defines all basic functionality which other modules build upon.  From there continue with "mod_admin" and see how it defines the admin interface, start with the webmachine resources to see which template is used by which resource.


FOR SQL MAGICIANS

Another useful source of information is the module "src/install/zp_install.erl", this erlang module contains the complete SQL datamodel.
Check also "src/install/zp_install_data.erl" as it defines the basic set of predicates, categories and whatnot.


Thank you and have fun with Zophrenic.
